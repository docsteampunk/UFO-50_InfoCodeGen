# UFO-50 Info Code Gen
Generates Info Codes in game and takes a screenshot.

The reason as to why code generation is done because on new profile, info is always seen on any game, even hidden ones.
1. Run the program, making sure to have all libraries installed
2. Press CTRL+ALT+J while running the application and while your cursor is hovering over the 'A' key.
3. Edit the python script to generate specific sequences, each is base 38.

Warning: Must have a screenshots folder and be executed in the folder that contains both of them. It doesn't work if you don't do that.
